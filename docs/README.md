## üéØ Quick Navigation

### By Namespace
- `jarvis` - SPy program execution
- `jeeves` - Run orchestration
- `journal` - Fact querying and storage
- `grimoire` - Process management
- `books` - Shared book implementations
- `threads` - Chat persistence
- `objects` - Artifact storage and signed URLs
- `triage` - Exception handling
- `envoy-gateway-system` - Public edge
- `user` - Identity management
- `bdk` - Book Development Kit
- `llm` - Model/prompt management
- `bifrost` - Network management
- `vault` - Secret management
- `customer-*` - Customer deployments

### By Technology
- **Rust Services**: Jarvis, Jeeves, Grimoire, BDK
- **PostgreSQL Databases**: Jeeves, Grimoire, Threads, UOM
- **InfluxDB**: Journal time-series storage
- **Kafka**: Event streaming backbone
- **Envoy**: Gateway and protocol translation
- **Python Books**: Customer book deployments

### Key Patterns
- **gRPC + REST**: All services expose gRPC with Envoy transcoding to REST
- **WebSocket Support**: Real-time features via gateway WebSocket routing
- **CRD-Based**: Book definitions, model definitions, and evaluations
- **Controller Pattern**: Automated lifecycle management
- **Service Mesh**: Inter-service communication via Kubernetes networking

## üîç Finding Information

Use the service index for quick lookups, or browse by category for detailed documentation. Each service document includes:
- Purpose and responsibilities
- API specifications (gRPC and REST)
- Data flow diagrams where applicable
- Infrastructure requirements
- Integration points
- Security considerations

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture Principles

- **Microservices**: Each service has a single responsibility
- **Event-Driven**: Kafka-based event streaming for loose coupling
- **Kubernetes-Native**: CRDs, controllers, and cloud-native patterns
- **Security-First**: Authentication, authorization, and encrypted communication
- **Observability**: Comprehensive logging, metrics, and tracing

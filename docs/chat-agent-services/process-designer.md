### Patch Operations
- **insert**: Add new content at specified location in process
- **update**: Replace existing content with new content
- **delete**: Remove content from specified location
- **append**: Add content to end of specified section

### Live Patching Flow
1. **User sends message** describing what they want
2. **Process Designer agent** analyzes current process state
3. **Agent generates patches** to update process content
4. **Patches streamed to UI** and applied in real-time
5. **Process view updates live** as user watches
6. **Conversation continues** with updated process context

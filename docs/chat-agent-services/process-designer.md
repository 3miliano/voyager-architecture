## API Specifications

### gRPC Streaming API (sopwriter.proto)

```protobuf
syntax = "proto3";
package sopwriter.v1;

import "threads/v1/threads.proto";

message ChatMessage {
  string thread_id = 1;
  threads.v1.Role role = 2; // USER | ASSISTANT | SYSTEM
  string content = 3;       // markdown/plain text
  string client_msg_id = 4; // optional client-generated id
}

service ProcessWriter {
  rpc Chat(stream ChatMessage) returns (stream ChatMessage);
}
```

#### Chat Service Implementation
The Chat service provides bidirectional streaming for real-time process development:

**Request Stream (Client to Server)**:
- **USER messages**: Requirements, questions, feedback from the user
- **SYSTEM messages**: Context updates, configuration changes
- **thread_id**: Links messages to specific process development sessions
- **client_msg_id**: Optional client-generated ID for message correlation

**Response Stream (Server to Client)**:
- **ASSISTANT messages**: Process content, code snippets, guidance, questions
- **Structured responses**: Processes formatted in markdown with embedded code blocks
- **Real-time feedback**: Immediate responses to user inputs

### REST APIs (via Gateway)

// WebSocket connection for real-time process development
const ws = new WebSocket('wss://api.voyager.com/v1/process-designer/sessions/session-uuid/chat');

// Send user message
ws.send(JSON.stringify({
  thread_id: "thread-uuid",
  role: "USER",
  content: "I need to create a process for processing refund requests",
  client_msg_id: "msg-123"
}));

// Receive assistant response
ws.onmessage = (event) => {
  const message = JSON.parse(event.data);

## Code Generation Patterns

### Basic SPy Program Structure
```spy
# Generated SPy program template
define AutomationProgram {
  # Configuration and setup
  configure() {
    # Initialize connections and settings
    setup_logging()
    validate_configuration()
  }
  
  # Main execution logic
  execute(input_data) {
    try {
      # Process input data
      processed_data = process_input(input_data)
      
      # Execute business logic
      result = execute_business_logic(processed_data)
      
      # Handle output
      return format_output(result)
    } catch (error) {
      # Error handling
      log_error(error)
      handle_error(error)
    }
  }
  
  # Cleanup and finalization
  cleanup() {
    # Close connections and cleanup resources
    close_connections()
    finalize_logging()
  }
}
```

### Advanced Integration Pattern
```spy
# Generated integration pattern
define IntegrationProgram {
  # External system connections
  connect_external_systems() {
    zendesk_client = connect_zendesk(config.zendesk_api_key)
    slack_client = connect_slack(config.slack_token)
    database = connect_database(config.db_connection_string)
  }
  
  # Data synchronization logic
  synchronize_data() {
    tickets = zendesk_client.get_tickets(filter="new")
    
    for ticket in tickets {
      # Process each ticket
      processed_ticket = process_ticket(ticket)
      
      # Update systems
      database.save_ticket(processed_ticket)
      
      if processed_ticket.priority == "high" {
        slack_client.send_alert(processed_ticket)
      }
    }
  }
  
  # Error handling with retry logic
  retry_with_backoff(operation, max_retries=3) {
    for attempt in range(max_retries) {
      try {
        return operation()
      } catch (TemporaryError as error) {
        if attempt < max_retries - 1 {
          wait_time = calculate_backoff(attempt)
          sleep(wait_time)
        } else {
          throw error
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
